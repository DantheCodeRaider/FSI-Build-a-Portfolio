    <!-- 
      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was a student, junior software developer, and aspiring computer engineer on 9/11. I was on my way to class that morning and listening to the news as I drove over to one of the student parking lots from my house off campus. I was almost to class when I heard that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center and I knew in that moment that something needed to be done. Instead of going to class that day, I visited the U.S. Marine Corps. recruiterâ€™s office. I had felt the call for action and wanted to be part of the solution.

      Now, more than twenty years later, I am a transitioning military special operations veteran. I found purpose and value in positively shaping environments, so together we can achieve a working future. It was an honor and a privilege to be part of an immense team who has ensured no major terrorist attack has occurred on U.S. soil since.
      
      As I transition, I am looking for that next team. I have begun my journey of pivoting back to the software development industry. My dedication, drive, and purpose to shape environments remain. I have a proven ability to lead diverse teams to accomplish complex tasks in demanding environments, both domestically and internationally. I am skilled at positioning people and resources in the right place, at the right time to achieve success. I am an experienced listener that will combine the goals and objectives of an organization with that of my teammates and leverage leadership abilities to achieve unity of effort.
      
      I am known for being a dynamic, focused, and results-driven operations manager and project management professional. I am a proven leader experienced at motivating a matrix of teams to complete critical tasks required to meet enterprise objectives. I also have experience conducting crisis site management, with the ability to think critically and make decisive decisions under stress.
      
      I enjoy solving programs and have a passion for using my software development skills to create or improve processes and meet customer needs. I look to the future with enthusiasm and optimism at the potential places I may land. I am eager to find a new team, new problems to solve, and new environments to shape. I am currently searching for software development internship opportunities in the Aug-Dec 2022 timeframe and future employment opportunities starting in January 2023.</p>
